# weatherForecast
Weather forecast web application! I built this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it allows you to check the weather in various cities.  I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for cities like Mumbai, Pune, Indore, and Delhi. The app displays the current temperature, weather description, wind speed, and more.
